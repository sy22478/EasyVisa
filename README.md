# EasyVisa

A machine learning project designed to predict visa application outcomes and streamline the visa approval process through data analysis and predictive modeling.

## Overview

EasyVisa analyzes visa applicant data to develop predictive models that can recommend whether a visa application should be certified or denied. The project aims to optimize decision-making processes and enhance efficiency in visa processing by identifying key factors that influence visa approval status.

## Objectives

- Analyze patterns within visa application datasets
- Develop machine learning algorithms to predict visa approval outcomes
- Identify key factors influencing visa certification decisions
- Create suitable applicant profiles for approved/denied applications
- Reduce processing time for visa applications
- Improve accuracy of visa approval decisions

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive exploratory data analysis of visa application data
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of various ML algorithms including:
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Ensemble Methods (Bagging, Boosting)
  - Hyperparameter Tuning
- **Predictive Modeling**: Accurate prediction of visa approval status
- **Data Visualization**: Charts and graphs to visualize patterns and insights
- **Performance Metrics**: Model evaluation using various classification metrics

## Dataset
